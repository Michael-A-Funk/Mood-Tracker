## Background & Functionality

Mood trackers are vital for mental health asthey build self-awareness, helping you identify patterns, triggers (like sleep, diet, events), and the impact of lifestyle on your emotions, allowing for proactive management, better coping strategies, and effective communication with therapists to refine treatment plans. They turn vague feelings into concrete data, revealing when negative moods occur and what helps improve them. The focus of this app was very much dedicated and for users suffering Bipolar and Schizoaffetive Conditions. 

In this app it was concilied this principle of mood tracking with the registration of intake of medication from the use, water intake (relevant for example for bipolar or schizoaffective patients, treated with lithum medication, that need to take special caution with proper water intake) and attendance of therapy sessions with a health professional. The app also has the priciple to remind user of taking medication, proper water intake and attending therapy sessions with a health professional. 

The app is able to let user insert data about medication, needed water intake and the schedule of therapy session, so it is taken in to account and to be remembered. It not only registeres the mood level, but also levels of fear, irritability, delusion, stress, sleep quality, sleep interruptions, alcohol and drug intake. Further it registeres activities/actions the user can do that normally enhance better mental health: sport, diet, midnfullness, journaling are the ones user can register. All this information is naturally registered with the time and date, and saved into a database.

Extra functionalities from this app include exporting this data to a pdf file, so the user and health professional can have access to this information without having to use solely the app.
