# Background

Mood trackers are vital for mental health asthey build self-awareness, helping you identify patterns, triggers (like sleep, diet, events), and the impact of lifestyle on your emotions, 
allowing for proactive management, better coping strategies, and effective communication with therapists to refine treatment plans. They turn vague feelings into concrete data, 
revealing when negative moods occur and what helps improve them.
